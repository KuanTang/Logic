# 1. Naïve set theory

**Key points:** Sets, elements, relations between and operations on sets

## ***1.1. Sets and  elements***

- A *set* is an abstract collection of distinct objects which are called the *members* or *elements* of that set.  $Y =\{a,b,c,d\}$

  notice: 

  - We write *A, B, C* **(Italic)** for sets, and $a, b, c,...$ or sometimes $x, y, z, . ..$ for members of sets.

  - We use notation with curly braces “$\{. . .\}$” which means the order of representation of elements is *irrelevant* to represent such a collection.

     If we use **angle bracket “$<…>$”**, which means the order of the elements is *relevant* , in this case $<a,b> = \{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$ 

  - ***singleton*:** A set with only one member.

  - ***empty set*:** a set to have no element at all ∅.

    *b* $\in$ *A* is read as *'b* is a member of *A*'.

    *b* $\notin$ *A* is read as *'b* is not a member of *A*'.

  ---

  **Exercise 01**: Given the following set:

  $A =\{a,b,c,2,3,4\}$ 								$E = \{a,b,\{c\}\}$

  $B = \{a,b\}$												$F = \emptyset $

  $C = \{c,2\}$												$G = \{\{a,b\},\{c,2\}\}$

  $D =\{b,c\}$ 

  classify each of the following statements as true or false
  
  (a)	$c \in A$				(b) $\{c\} \in E$			(c) $\{c\} \in C$	
  
  (d)  ${B} \subseteq G$				(e) $D \subseteq G$ 			(f) $ \{\{c\}\} \subseteq E$ 
  
  
  
  **Exercise 02**:  For any arbitrary set *S*,
  
  (a) is *S* a member of {*S*}? 
  
  (b) is {*S*} a member of {*S*}?
  
  (c) is {*S*} a subset of {*S*}?
  
  (d) what is the set whose only member is {*S*}?

---

## ***1.2. Specification of sets***

Three main methods for describing sets exist: 

(1) **List notation**: by listing all its members. 

e.g., the set whose members are the world's longest river, the first president of the United States and the number five {The Amazon River, George Washington, 5}

 (2) **Predicate notation**: by stating a property which an object must have to qualify as a member of it

 e.g., the predicate *'x* is an even number between 3 and 9'  = {4, 6, 8}

 (3) **Recursive rules**:  by defining a set of rules which generate its members.

e.g.,  the set *E* = {4,6,8, ...} can be generated by the following rule:

​	a) 4 $\in$ *E*

​	b) If *x* $\in$ *E*, then *x* +2 $\in$ *E*

​	c) Nothing else belongs to *E*.

---

**Exercise 03**:  Write a specification of the following sets. 

(a)  $\{5,10,15,20,... \}$

(b)  $\{0,2,-2,4,-4,6,-6,...\}$

(c)  $ \{300,301,302,...,399,400\}$

---

## ***1.3. Identity & Cardinality***

- **Identity:** two sets are identical if and only if they have exactly the same members. 

- **Cardinality:** The number of members in a set *A* is called the *cardinality* of *A,* written |*A*| or #(*A*). The cardinality of a finite set is given by one of the natural numbers.

---

**Exercise 04**: Let $A = \{x|x$ is a positive integer less than 7$\}$

i). What is the List notation and Recursive rules of $A$?

ii). What is the $|A|$ ?

---

## ***1.4 Subsets***



- $ A\subseteq B $ : When every member of a set *A* is also a member of a set *B* we call *A* a *subset* of *B.* 

  Note that *B* may contain other members besides those of *A,* but this is not necessarily so. Thus the subset relation allows any set to be a subset of itself. 

- $A \subset B$ : To exclude the case of a set being a subset of itself, the notion is called *proper subset*.
- $A \subsetneq B$ : *A* is not a subset of *B,* hence that *A* has at least one member which is not a member of $B$.

---

**Exercise 05: **Classify each of the following statements as true or false:

 a) $\{a,b,c\} \subseteq \{s,b,a,e,g,i,c\} $

b) $\{a,b,j\} \subsetneq \{s,b,a,e,g,i,c\} $

c) $\{a,b,c\} \sub \{s,b,a,e,g,i,c\} $

d) $\emptyset \sub \{a\}$

e) $\{a,\{a\}\} \subseteq \{a,b,\{a\}\}$

f) $\{\{a\}\} \subsetneq \{a\}$

g) $\{a\} \subsetneq \{\{a\}\}$

h) $\{a\} \in \{\{a\}\}$

---

## ***1.5 Power sets***

- **Power set:** The set whose members are all the subsets of a given set *A*, write as $\mathscr{P}(A)$. 

  Suppose $A = \{a,b\}$; then the power set of *A, $\mathscr{P}(A)$,* is $ \{\{a\},\{b\},\{a,b\},\emptyset \}.$ 

  

  If the cardinality of A is some natural number *n,* then $\mathscr{P}(A)$ has cardinality $2^n$ i.e., 2 raised to the n power, or 2 x 2 x 2 x ... x 2 (n times). The power set of A is sometimes denoted as $2^A$.

---

**Exercise 06: **Specify each of the following sets by listing its members:

(a)  $\mathscr{P}$ $\emptyset$ 		 			  	(b) $\mathscr{P}$ {$\emptyset$}						(c) $\mathscr{P}\mathscr{P}$ {*a*}

---

## ***1.6 Set operations***

- The *union* of *A* and *B* 

  ​												$A \cup B = _{def}\{x|x \in A~ {or} ~x \in B\}$

- The *intersection* of *A* and *B* 

  ​												$A \cap B = _{def}\{x|x \in A~ {or} ~x \in B\}$

- The *relative complement* *of* *A* and *B*

  ​										 	  $ A- B= _{def}\{x|x \in A~ {or} ~x \notin B\}$

- the *complement* of a set *A,* 

  ​													$A' = _{def}\{x|x \notin A\} = U - A$ 

---

**Exercise 07:**  Let $A = \{a,b,c\}, B=\{c,d\}$ and $C=\{d,e,f\}$

what are (i) $A \cap B$   		(ii) $A \cap (B \cup C)$ 				(iii) $ A - B$

**Exercise 08.** Show that the Distributive Law 4(a) is true by constructing Venn diagrams for 

$X \cap (Y\cup Z) $ and $(X\cap  Y) \cup (X \cap Z)$.
